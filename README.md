# PlantIll

 

This project is two parts: 
    - Deep learning part :
    we did train a model for plant disease recognition, You can find the work under the folder /DPModel, more explanation below
    (Dataset, Weights, Training)
    - Mobile dev part :
    We build this part using Flutter

## Deep Learning Model

### Dataset: 

  -  The dataset we worked with contains 39 classes, The healthy plants are apart of these classes, there is also Background
  class it refers to the images where there is no plant or plants which those not exist in our classes.

### The models: 

  - The link for the weights we got after training [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-5S1v6ydXjdHfUaBWsoXkO8v7vqegCIY?usp=sharing)
  
    #### The training:
      - All the models were trained respecting the following steps : 
          * First step :
          We did transfer learning for the model so we did
